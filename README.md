# Shor-s-Algorithm_Quantum

Shor’s algorithm was invented for integer factorization in 1994.  This algorithm is based on quantum computing and hence referred to as a quantum algorithm. The algorithm finds the prime factors of an integer P. Shor’s algorithm executes in polynomial time which is of the order polynomial in log N. On a classical computer,  it takes the execution time of the order O((log N)3).

If a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits could operate without succumbing to quantum noise and other quantum-decoherence phenomena, then Shor's algorithm could be used to break public-key cryptography schemes, such as the widely-used RSA scheme. RSA is based on the assumption that factoring large integers is computationally intractable. 

A few months we had implemented RSA encryption from scratch with tweakable security parameters. This is a practical implementation of Shor's Algorithm to break our RSA encryption layer.
